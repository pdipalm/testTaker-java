For this project, I'm going to attempt to make an online test taking application. Teacher will be able to make
and log into accounts, and from there, they will be able to make new tests. They will also be able to see student
submissions for the test and look at the questions and correct answers, as well as being able to delete the test.
On the student side of things, the student will enter the test id and their name and will be able to create a 
submission for the test. They will recive their score out of 100 after and see how many questions they got right.
The objective is to create a simple and easy to use application for teachers as well as students.
